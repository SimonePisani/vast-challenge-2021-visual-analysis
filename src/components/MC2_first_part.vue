                <p>
                    As we can see from this initial overview, among the shops on the Abila island we can see some that
                    are much more popular than the others, mainly cafès and restaurants such as <strong>Katerina's
                    Cafè</strong>, <strong>Hippokampos</strong>,
                    <strong>Brew've Been Served</strong>,
                    <strong>Hallowed Grounds</strong> or <strong>Guy's Gyros</strong>.
                    It's also important to pay attention over the fact that, in almost all the shops
                    listed above, its possible to notice a - more or less - slight drop in the number of transactions
                    during the weekends, days in which the transactions carried out in cultural or leisure places such
                    as
                    Ahaggo Museum or Desafio Golf Course tend to increase.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another interesting aspect is rapresented by the statistical analysis of the data, referring to
                    indices such as mean, mode and standard deviation. The analysis, carried out starting from the shops
                    first and then from the days,
                    has highlighted a great disparity over the transactions among the different shops: the fact that the
                    mode and, above all, the standard deviation have values much
                    higher than the mean, identify a large dispersion of the values compared to it
                </p>

                <p>On the other hand, those anomalies don't appear so consistently in the case of the analysis over
                    days: here the pattern
                    seems to be decidedly more stable, with trends that tend to repeat themselves such as
                    the one already described above about weekends.</p>

                <p>
                    The filters also allow us to have an overview over the transactions made using only
                    <b-link @click="set_radioMap('credit')">credit cards</b-link>
                    or
                    <b-link @click="set_radioMap('loyalty')">loyalty cards</b-link>
                    .
                    The algorithm on which the data matching between the credit cards and loyalty cards
                    datasets was
                    based is, unfortunately, far from being reliable for several reasons, first of all, the data
                    structure. <br>
                    The matching was carried out on the basis of three fields: location, price and timestamp of the
                    transaction. Among those three data, only the first one doesn't present any
                    particular problem. On the other hand, both the credit cards and loyalty cards datasets had a "date"
                    field, with the difference that, in the first case, there was also the transaction time which is
                    absent in the second case.<br>
                    As far as the price is concerned, the algorithm doesn't take in account its possible variations such
                    as the case of eventual cashbacks or loyalty card's discounts
                    which in this way would make the money movements in the same transaction looking different.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In conclusion, the algorithm has given good results showing that it may be possible to carry out a
                    transaction using cash or without using a loyalty card.
                    However, the matching failed to trace a 1 to 1 relationship between credit cards and loyalty cards,
                    both due to the already described low reliability of the algorithm but also due to the fact that the
                    last digits of the credit cards (used as ID) are not necessarily unique.

                    In this section, the goal is to give a more "focus oriented" view of the data,
                    analyzing the transactions in the different commercial establishments during the various days
                    covered by the study.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The analysis is conducted through the insertion of four different graphs.<br/>
                    The first one is a Sankey diagram which is used to trace the relationship [credit card-loyalty
                    card-price of transaction-transaction time] between each transaction carried out during the various
                    days.<br/>
                    The second one is a piechart used to show the percentages of transactions conducted with both
                    the credit card and the loyalty card, those carried out using only the credit card and those made
                    using only the loyalty card.<br/>
                    The third one is a barchart which, in a certain sense, simplifies the analysis conducted within the
                    Sankey diagram, creating a visualization that allows us to quickly understand the various trends
                    relating to the times of the various commercial operations.<br/>
                    The last one is a scatterplot that allows us to view the maximum and minimum price peaks both by day
                    and by hour in the carious commercial establishment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The observation of the graphs, in addition to confirming the presence of some trends characterizing
                    the commercial establishments, has brought to light various anomalies present in the data.

                    By adding GPS data to the analysis, it is theoretically possible to find the people connected to a
                    credit card and a loyalty card, observing the moments in which the person is not moving and
                    trying to match with the transactions.

                    However, there are several possible combinations: a single car id seems to match several credit
                    cards. Here is a solution for a unique combination of car id, credit card and loyalty card.
